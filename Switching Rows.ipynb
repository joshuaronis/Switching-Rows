    "**Summary:** \n",
    "        \n",
    "We will start with a list of alphebatized letters, and a list of every possible permutation of those alphebatized letters. They are called alphebatizedLetters and permLettersList accordingly. \n",
    "\n",
    "For each permutated list of letters within permLettersList, we will count the number of switches required to get back to alphebatizedLetters, and store the number of switches in within a dictionary, called numSwitchesDict.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way we will count the number of switches required is best shown with an example. \n",
    "\n",
    "Say alphebatizedLetters is [a, b, c, d] and permLetters is [d, a, b, c]. \n",
    "\n",
    "The program will start by checking the 0th entry in permLetters. It will ask itself if that's what the entry should be by comparing that entry with the 0th entry in alphebatizedLetters. Since it sees there is a 'd' where there should be an 'a', the program realizes there is something wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the program will edit permLetters to make it look a little more like alphebatizedLetters. It will put the 'd' in the position is should be, and put the letter currently in the position where 'd' should be in the position where 'd' is. \n",
    "\n",
    "So the program will change [d, a, b, c] to [c, a, b, d]. Note that now d is in the correct position. This counts as 1 switch, and the program will keep track of that. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now the program will do the same thing. It will compare our new permLetters [c, a, b, d] to [a, b, c, d] and ask if that 'c' should be there. It sees that it shouldn't, and it does another switch to give us [b, a, c, d]. Note that now 'c' is in the correct position. Once again, the program will record its done another switch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the program will do the same thing. It will compare our new permLetters [b, a, c, d] to [a, b, c, d] and ask if that 'b' should be there. It sees that it shouldn't, and it does another switch to give us [a, b, c, d]. Note that now 'b' is in the correct position. Once again, the program will record its done another switch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the program will do the same thing, and see that the 0th entries in permLetters and alphebatizedLetters match. It will then move on to check the 1st entry, and see that those match as well, then the 2nd entries and see that those match as well, then the 3rd entry, and see that those match as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "The program will conclude that all the entries match, and that there are no more switches needed to get back to alphebatizedLetters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me recap what the program did:\n",
    "\n",
    "It started with [a, b, c, d] and [d, a, b, c]. It checked if the 0th entry 'd' was correct. It saw that it wasn't, and it switched it with the 'c' where in order to put the 'd' in the corret place. Now we have [c, a, b, d].\n",
    "\n",
    "Next it checked if the 'c' (still the 0th entry) in [c, a, b, d] was in the correct place. It saw that it wasn't, so it switched it with the 'b' to get [b, a, c, d]\n",
    "\n",
    "It did this again, once again checking the 0th entry ('b'), and made one more switch to get [a, b, c, d]\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it saw that the 0th entry was correct, it was an 'a' as it should be, so it moved on to checking the 1st entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "It saw that the 1st entry was correct, it was a 'b' as it should be, so it moved on to checking the 2nd entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "It saw that the 2nd entry was correct, it was an 'c' as it should be, so it moved on to checking the 3th entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "It saw that the 3th entry was correct, it was an 'd' as it should be, and it concluded that every entry must be correct, and no more switches were needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, note that in this example the program only had to switch the 0th entry around over and over. That isn't necessarilly the case. \n",
    "        \n",
    "Imagine if our original permLetters had been [a, c, b, d]. The program would've checked the 0th entry, and seen it was correct. Then it would've checked the 1st entry, and seen it was incorrect. So it would've instead switched around the 1st entry to its correct place and gotten [a, b, c, d]. Then it would've checked the 1st entry again, and seen it was correct, and moved on to the 2nd entry, and so on and so on until the program reached the end, having kept track of the number of switches it had to do.\n",
    "        \n",
    "***Okay that was the end of the summary. Now a list of what every step does in the code of the next module***\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**List describing code:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a dictionary that will record as its $n_{th}$ element the number of permutated lists that took $n$ switches in order to get back to the original alphebatizedLetters. For example, for $[ [a, b, c], [a, c, b], [b, a, c], [b, c, a], [c, a, b], [c, b, a] ]$, the dictionary will tell us that 1 of those took 0 switches, 2 of those took 2 switches, and 3 of those took 1 switch. It will look like this: ***{0: 1, 1: 3, 2: 2}***\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Next, we define a function that will actually count the number of switches. It takes in the original alphebatizedLetters we want to get back to, and permLettersList, a list holding every single possible permutation of the letters - each permutation of the letters being a list in itself.  For each of those possible permutated lists of letters in permLettersLists, we will record the number of switches to get back to the original.\n",

    "4. For every permutated list permLetters in permLettersList we will count the number of switches to get back to alphebatizedLetters\n",

    "\n",

    "14. Checks if the rth entry in permLetters matches with the rth entry in alphebatizedLetters. If it doesn't...\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Add +1 to the variable keeping track of the total number of switches needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "17. Puts the rth letter in permLetters where it should actually be. For example, if permLetters is [c, a, b] and the program is checking the r = 0th letter in permLetters, it will see that c should be where b is, and it will switch them around to get [b, a, c]. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1819. Prints out what permLetters is now after done a switch.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2021. If the rth letter in permLetters was correct to begin with, then the program will continue by checking if the r+1th letter was correct. So it iterates r by adding 1 to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "23. Once it has fixed every letter in permLetters, r will have reached len(permLetters), and the program will exit the loop defined in 10. The program will tell us that after countSwitches number of switches, we've been able to turn permLetters into the correct alphebatizedLetters.\n",
